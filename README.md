# MPC-Tuning: Hybrid Optimization for Model Predictive Controllers

## üìñ Overview
This repository contains the source code for **MPC-Tuning**, developed by **Sergio A. C. Giraldo (principal), Pr√≠amo A. Melo, and Argimiro R. Secchi** at the **Laboratory of Software Development for Process Control and Optimization (LADES)**, affiliated with the **Programa de Engenharia Qu√≠mica (PEQ), Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).**

The purpose of this project is to provide **a hybrid tuning methodology for Model Predictive Controllers (MPC)**, which optimizes both continuous and discrete tuning parameters to improve control performance while reducing computational effort.

This repository serves as a resource for **researchers, control engineers, and practitioners** working in **process control, predictive modeling, and automation**.

## üöÄ Features
- Hybrid tuning method for MPC optimization.
- Implementation with MATLAB's Model Predictive Control Toolbox.
- Support for both **linear and nonlinear systems**.
- Code adapted for practical applications and industrial simulations.

## üì¶ Installation
To install and use this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
# Required MATLAB Toolbox:
MATLAB Model Predictive Control Toolbox
```

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LADES-PEQ/MPC-Tuning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd MPC-Tuning
   ```
3. Open MATLAB and add the project path:
   ```matlab
   addpath(genpath('MPC-Tuning'))
   ```
4. Run an example:
   ```matlab
   run('MPC-Tuning/Examples/Example1.m')
   ```
5. (Optional) Modify parameters in `mpc_tuning.m` to adapt the optimization to your system.
