# Hybrid Tuning Algorithms for Model Predictive Controllers

This repository contains the hybrid tuning algorithms proposed in the following article:

> Giraldo, Sergio A. C., Pr√≠amo A. Melo, and Argimiro R. Secchi. 2022. "Tuning of Model Predictive Controllers Based on Hybrid optimization" Processes 10, no. 2:351. [https://doi.org/10.3390/pr10020351](https://doi.org/10.3390/pr10020351)

These codes have been adapted to work directly with the Matlab Predictive Control Toolbox. As a result, the dynamic outcomes may slightly differ from those presented in the paper. However, the same methodology is followed. This adaptation enables more agile code distribution and encourages improvements.


# MPC Controller Tuning Manual

This manual provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the MATLAB script for tuning an MPC controller using the MATLAB MPC Toolbox and the proposed hybrid optimization methodology. Please follow the steps below:

1. **Define the system model (linear or nonlinear) and sampling period (Ts)**: Specify the transfer function for your system (Psr) and input/output delay matrix (Lr). Set the sampling period (Ts) and the number of iterations (nit).

2. **Define the setpoint for the study**: Specify the setpoint values (Xsp) for the controlled variables in your system.

3. **Input a desired reference trajectory**: Provide a reference trajectory (Pref) that the optimization algorithm will attempt to match the output response to.

4. **Create the MPC controller object**: Set up the MPC controller object using the discrete-time model (sysd) and the specified sample time (Ts).

5. **Specify nominal values for inputs and outputs**: Define nominal values for the plant inputs and outputs in the MPC object (mpc_toolbox.Model.Nominal).

6. **Specify constraints**: Define constraints for the MPC controller inputs and outputs (InUmx, InUmn, Umx, Umn, Ymx, Ymn).

7. **Set constraints for MV, MV Rate, and OV**: Set constraints on the control inputs, their increments, and the plant outputs in the MPC object.

8. **Specify simulation options**: Set simulation options for the MPC controller using the 'mpcsimopt' function.

9. **Call the MPCTuning algorithm**: Call the MPCTuning function with the required input arguments (mpcobj, Sp, linear, w, fi, Pref). You may also provide optional input arguments for non-linear systems (nbp, nbc, nlmodel, init, optimset). The MPCTuning function finds the optimal values for the MPC algorithm parameters (delta, lambda, Np, Nun).

The provided script includes code for defining the system model, setting up the MPC controller object, specifying constraints, and calling the MPCTuning algorithm. Follow these instructions along with the script to tune your MPC controller using the proposed hybrid optimization methodology.
